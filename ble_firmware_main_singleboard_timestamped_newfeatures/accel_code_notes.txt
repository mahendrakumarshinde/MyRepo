    0x14 ACC_BGW_SOFTRESET (write 0xB6 to soft reset)
    0x0F ACC_PMU_RANGE (write Ascale (choose 2g) & 0x0F; 0x0F is a mask)
    0x10 ACC_PMU_BW (write bandwidth of 1000Hz (0b01111) to PMU_BW)
    0x13 ACC_D_HBW (pick 0 (filtered) and 0 (shadowing))

Update sequence:
- replace register numbers (constants.h)
- replace accel scales from 2048 to 32768 (getAres())
- replace AFS_2G; 3 bits to 2 bits ()
- replace WHO_AM_I check on accelerometer in setup() and rename methods from BMX055 -> MPU
- copy pasted initMPU9250 from Kris Winer's github
- temporarily removed fastcompaccelMPU9250 (we can reimplement compensation later)
- copy pasted readAccelData from Kris Winer's github



Notes:
- why was aRes / 2048 = 2^11 when vals are 2^12?
- keeping Ascale = 2G's
- we are using LPF for BMX055 right?
- do we do wake-on-motion interrupt?
